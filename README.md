# Code 42 - 2_AN_4

Code 42 is an android application that enables professors to give custom, tailored programming assignments.

In our App Development course, my team and I created an Android app that teaches kids to code in Java, Python, and Go, incorporating class management features like those in Zybooks and LeetCode. Professors can customize assignments, manage courses, enroll students, and adjust grades. To ensure security, we implemented a robust protocol with pre-execution analysis and validation checks to prevent malicious code from running on our servers.

Code includes unit tests and CI/CD pipelines for safe and secure development

Unfortunately, we performed version controlling on ISU's GitLab, so we are unable to show individual commits.
